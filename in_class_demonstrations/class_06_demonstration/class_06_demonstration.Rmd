## PDF Parsing with Tabula

Tabula works best when tables in PDFs are clearly defined and have nicely-formatted information. Here's a perfect example: [active voters by county in Maryland](https://elections.maryland.gov/press_room/2020_stats/Eligible%20Active%20Voters%20by%20County%20-%20PG20.pdf).

[Download and install Tabula](https://tabula.technology/). Tabula works much the same way as Open Refine does -- it works in the browser by spinning up a small webserver in your computer. Start it as you would any other desktop application, then go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in your browser.

When Tabula opens, you click browse to find the PDF on your computer somewhere, and then click import. After it imports, click autodetect tables. You'll see red boxes appear around what Tabula believes are the tables. You'll see it does a pretty good job at this.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/md_voters.png"))
```

ow you can hit the green "Preview & Export Extracted Data" button on the top right. You should see something very like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/md_voters2.png"))
```

You can now export that extracted table to a CSV file using the "Export" button. And then we can read it into R:

```{r}
voters_by_county <- read_csv("tabula-Eligible Active Voters by County - PG20.csv")
View(voters_by_county)
```

Boom - we're good to go.

## When it looks good, but needs a little fixing

Here's a slightly more involved PDF. Check out the table on page 4 of [this SBA PDF](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/PPP_Report_Public_210531-508.pdf).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ppp_1.png"))
```

Looks like a spreadsheet, right? Save that PDF file to your computer in a place where you'll remember it (like a Downloads folder).

Now let's repeat the steps we did to import the PDF into Tabula and autodetect the tables. Page 4 should look like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ppp_2.png"))
```

We just want the table on page 4, which shows 2021 loan activity by type of lender, so hit the "Clear All Selections" button to remove the red boxes. Now, in Tabula, let's draw a box around the table on page 4. Click and drag to draw the box.

Now you can hit the green "Preview & Export Extracted Data" button on the top right. You should see something very like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ppp_3.png"))
```

You can now export that extracted table to a CSV file using the "Export" button. And then we can read it into R:

```{r}
lender_types <- read_csv("tabula-PPP_Report_Public_210531-508.csv")
View(lender_types)
```

## Cleaning up the data in R

```{r}
lender_types <- read_csv("tabula-PPP_Report_Public_210531-508.csv", skip=1, col_names=c("type", "count", "approved", "net_dollars"))
lender_types <- lender_types %>% mutate(net_dollars=as.numeric(parse_number(net_dollars)))
View(lender_types)
```
