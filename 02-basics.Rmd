# R basics

[R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is a programming language, one specifically geared toward data analysis. 

Like all programming languages, it has certain built-in functions. 

There are many ways you can write and execute R code. The first, and most basic, is the console, shown here as part of a software tool called [RStudio (Desktop Open Source Edition)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) that we'll be using all semester. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/verybasics1.png"))
```

Think of the console like talking directly to the R language engine that's busy working inside your computer. You use it send R commands, making sure to use the only language it understands, which is R.  The R language engine processes those commands, and sends information back to you.  

Using the console is direct, but it has some drawbacks and some quirks we'll get into later.  Let's examine a basic example of how the console works.  

If you load up R Studio, type 2+2 into the console and hit enter it will spit out the number 4, as displayed below. 

```{r}
2+2
```

It's not very complex, and you knew the answer before hand, but you get the idea. With R, we can compute things. 

We can also store things for later use under a specific name. In programming languages, these are called **variables**. We can assign things to variables using this left-facing arrow: `<-`. The `<-` is a called an **assignment operator**.

If you load up R studio and type this code in the console...

```{r}
number <- 2
```

...and then type this code, it will spit out the number 4, as show below.

```{r}
number * number
```

We can have as many variables as we can name. We can even reuse them (but be careful you know you're doing that or you'll introduce errors). 

If you load up R studio and type this code in the console...

```{r}
firstnumber <- 1
secondnumber <- 2 
```

...and then type this, it will split out the number 6, as shown below.

```{r}
(firstnumber + secondnumber) * secondnumber
```

We can store anything in a variable. A whole table. A list of numbers. A single word. A whole book. All the books of the 18th century. Variables are really powerful. We'll explore them at length. 

A quick note about the console: After this brief introduction, we won't spend much time in R Studio actually writing code directly into the console.  Instead, we'll write code in fancied-up text files -- interchangably called R Markdown or R Notebooks -- as will be explained in the next chapter. But that code we write in those text files will still *execute* in the console, so it's good to know how it works. 

## About libraries

The real strength of any programming language is the external libraries (often called "packages") that power it. The base language can do a lot, but it's the external libraries that solve many specific problems -- even making the base language easier to use. 

With R, there are hundreds of free, useful libraries that make it easier to do data journalism, created by a community of thousands of R users in multiple fields who contribute to open-source coding projects. 

For this class, we'll make use of several external libraries. 

Most of them are part of a collection of libraries bundled into one "metapackage" called the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) that streamlines tasks like: 

* Loading data into R. (We'll use the [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) Tidyverse library) 
* Cleaning and reshaping the data before analysis. (We'll use the the [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/index.html) and [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) Tidyverse libraries)
* Data analysis. (We'll use the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) Tidyverse library) 
* Data visualization (We'll use the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) Tidyverse library) 

To install packages, we use the function `install.packages()`.

You only need to install a library once, the first time you set up a new computer to do data journalism work. You never need to install it again, unless you want to update to a newer version of the package.   

To install all of the Tidyverse libraries at once, the function is `install.packages('tidyverse')`. You can type it directly in the console.

To use the R Markdown files mentioned earlier, we also need to install a Tidyverse-related library that doesn't load as part of the core Tidyverse package.  The package is called, conveniently, [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/docs/). The code to install that is `install.packages('rmarkdown')`
